      <description>Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Tracey. I am a self-taught software engineer with applied mathematics background. After going through A Tour of Go, I found that Go was actually a neat and simple language to learn and started to develop more interest in programming. While still in my learning journey, I create this blog to share interesting problems and projects that I have done in Go, as well as some other useful resources.</description>
