In this application, we will discuss about stockbot that returns stock prices of a company. The architecture is as follows.
For one who comes to this repository first, I have another repository call weatherbot in which I have described step by step how to build a weatherbot for querying weather conditon of a location. Most of the steps of implementation for two bots are similar, including building a Slack bot user, subscribing to app mentioned event, creating a Go function which is a HTTP handler.</description>

      <description>Source code
In this repository, I&amp;rsquo;m going to create a weatherbot for querying weather condition of a given location. The idea of writing a Slack bot in Go was inspired by rapidloop&amp;rsquo;s slackbot for RTM API. At the moment, Slack platform provides a range of APIs that Slack apps can access to including events API, web API, Audit Logs APIs beside RTM API which was used in rapidloop&amp;rsquo;s implementation. As RTM API is being phased out in favour of events API, in this application, events API will be used.</description>
