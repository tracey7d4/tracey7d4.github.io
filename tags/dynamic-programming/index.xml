Dynamic programming solves the complex problem by breaking it into simpler sub-problems, solving each of those once, and storing their solution for later use. Dynamic programming uses memoisation and tabulation technique for improving its performance.
Memoisation is a technique of optimisation by storing the solutions of function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs are called again.
Tabulation is an approach by first filling up a table, then solving the original problem based on the solutions in this table.</description>
