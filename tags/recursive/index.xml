Dynamic programming solves the complex problem by breaking it into simpler sub-problems, solving each of those once, and storing their solution for later use. Dynamic programming uses memoisation and tabulation technique for improving its performance.
Memoisation is a technique of optimisation by storing the solutions of function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs are called again.
Tabulation is an approach by first filling up a table, then solving the original problem based on the solutions in this table.</description>

      <description>Source code
Golang supports recursion, that allows function to call itself. A recursive function has a base case which is the final executable statement in recursion. The base case is needed to be defined carefully, otherwise the program will go on to infinite loop.
Let&amp;rsquo;s consider the following example that applied recursive function directly.
Our program is to find super digit on an given integer x, which is defined as follows.</description>
