      <description>Source code
We are going to solve this problem by using Dynamic Programming with memoisation and tabulation techniques.
Problem Description The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is to compute the length of a longest subsequence common to all given sequences. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example, the LCS of two sequence {1,2,3} and {1,3,5} is {1,3}, and has the length is 2.</description>
