Problem description An array is said to have a majority element if more than half of its elements are the same.
Given a non-empty array arr. Check to see if the array has a majority element.
Implementation Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at some approaches of solving the given problem.
1- Brute Force algorithm This approach is to find the occurrences of each element. As soon as there is an occurrence of an element is greater than a half, we know that this array has majority element and then return true.</description>

Go map Go map is built-in type that implements a hash table - a very useful data structure in computer science. A Go map type is defined as
map[Key]Value We use make function to initialise a map, and also need to define types for map&amp;rsquo;s Key and Value. For example, initialisation of a map of string keys to float64 values is as follows.
m := make(map[string]float64) Let have a quick look at an small example about inserting, looking up, and deteting data from a map.</description>
