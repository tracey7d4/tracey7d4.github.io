      <title>Iterative method to traverse a tree</title>

Problem description In previous post we have already traversed the tree using recursive method (see link). Recursive method is neat in term of length of code, and easy to understand. Recursion, however, runs slower than iteration, especially when the tree is very deep that requires a considerable number of recursive calls.
In this post, we will traverse a binary tree using iterative method, in which all tree nodes are iterated over in some manner.</description>

      <title>Design a special Stack that supports finding max/min values in constant time</title>

Description Our task is to design a stack that supports some operations such as push a key in, pop an element out, and return maximum and minimum values. We also need to make sure all those operations are done in a constant time.
The program lets user type in queries, and only terminates when user stops the program or when user type in &amp;ldquo;stop&amp;rdquo; query.
Algorithm The idea is to use 3 different stacks, one to store the actual elements, the other two are auxiliary stacks to store maximum and minimum elements.</description>

      <title>Check for balanced brackets in a text - Stack</title>

      <description>Source code
Given a text that contains any brackets from the set [], {}, (). Our program is to check whether the text uses brackets correctly. If there is no mistake, print out &amp;ldquo;Balanced&amp;rdquo;. Otherwise, find index of the first unmatched closing brackets, or the last opening bracket without corresponding closing one, and print out &amp;ldquo;Unbalanced at index index&amp;rdquo;.
For example:
[()] &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Balanced
[(] &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Unbalanced at index 3</description>
