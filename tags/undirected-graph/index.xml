Graph is a data structure that represents pairwise relationships between vertices. It has two basic components - vertices and edges. The edges are used to connect pairs of vertices.
A graph can be directed or undirected. In an undirected graph, all the edges are bi-directional. It means that in an undirected graph, you can traverse in both directions from a vertex to the other one as long as there is an edge between them.</description>
