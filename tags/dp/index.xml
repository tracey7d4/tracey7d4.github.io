We are going to solve this problem by using Dynamic Programming with memoisation and tabulation techniques.
Problem Description The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is to compute the length of a longest subsequence common to all given sequences. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example, the LCS of 2 sequence {1,2,3} and {1,3,5} is {1,3}, and has the length is 2.</description>

      <description>Source code
Dynamic programming solves the complex problem by breaking it into simpler sub-problems, solving each of those once, and storing their solution for later use. Dynamic programming uses memoisation and tabulation technique for improving its performance.
Memoisation is a technique of optimisation by storing the solutions of function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs are called again.
Tabulation is an approach by first filling up a table, then solving the original problem based on the solutions in this table.</description>
